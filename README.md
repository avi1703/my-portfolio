# The Portfolio

I developed my portfolio using the MERN stack, incorporating NextJs and TailWind for enhanced functionality and styling. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of MongoDB for efficient data storage, Express for backend routing and API development, NextJs for dynamic UI creation, Node.js for server-side execution, TailWind for streamlined frontend design and react-icons library for different icons. This hands-on experience in full-stack web development has emphasized the importance of integrating different technologies to create robust and user-friendly applications.
